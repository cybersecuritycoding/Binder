# Cybersecurity Coding Jupyter Notebook for Binder

[Associated Course](https://www.cybersecuritycoding.com/courses/)

## Binder PowerShell Jupyter Notebook
This repository can be used to spin up a free Docker instance that will support most of the courseware needed for Cybersecurity Coding.com courses. This can be used in many instances instead of having a dedicated virtual machine. This environment is not persistent so if you want to keep your lab notebooks, make sure you save them locally or push to a git repo.
